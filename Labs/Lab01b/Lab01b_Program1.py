# [1.a] My name and UIN
print("1.a: Name and UIN: Chase Johnson: 327008712")

# [1.b] Interesting fact about myself
print("1.b: Interesting Fact: I grew up on a farm")

# [1.c] Voltage Calculation
print("1.c: Voltage: ", 20 * 5)
print("    Equation: V = IR")
# V = IR where
# V is the voltage,
# I is the current, and
# R is the resistance

# [1.d] Kinetic Energy Calculation
print("1.d: Kinetic Energy: ", 100 * (21 ** 2) / 2)
print("    Equation: KE = (0.5)m(v^2)")
# KE = (0.5)m(v^2) where
# m is the mass, and
# v is the velocity

# [1.e] Reynolds Number Calculation
print("1.e: Reynolds Number: ", 100 * 2.5 / 1.2)
print("    Equation: Re = u * L / v")
# Re = u * L / ν where
# u is the fluid velocity,
# L is the characteristic linear dimension, and
# v is the kinematic viscosity

# [1.f] Energy Radiated per Unit Surface Area Calculation
print("1.f: Energy Radiated: ", (5.67 * (10 ** (-8)))*(2200 ** 4))
print("    Equation: E = σT^4")
# E = σT^4
# Where σ is the constant of proportionality,
# T is the absolute temperature, and
# E is the radiant heat energy

#  [1.g] Shear Stress Calculation
print("1.g: Shear Stress: ", 2 + (20 * tan(35)))
print("    Equation: |𝜏| = 𝐶 + 𝜎′(tan(∅))")
# |𝜏| = 𝐶 + 𝜎′(tan(∅))
# Where C is the cohesion,
# 𝜎′ is the effective stress, and
# ∅ is the angle of internal friction
