Texas A&M ENGR102 Course Materials

Howdy,
My name is Chase Johnson and I am a freshman Computer Engineering major at Texas A&M University.

This repository is home to both my work and the work done with my group from my first year Engineering class: ENGR 102. 
Please keep in mind that the folder entitled "Group Labs" is work done by myself, Anna Olmedo, Gustavo Rodriguez, and Brian Choi.

None of the work contained in this repository is to be used for any assignment sponsored by any school, university, or organization for any reason. It is strictly here for the purposes of a project portfolio with explicit permissions from the group members stated above.
